## Design Explorations

According to my interviews, I mapped out an As-is journey map to help me visualize the current process of web-based academic research and the pin points during the process:

Based on the journey map, I started my ideation to explore design opportunities.

## Analysis of User Interviews

I coded all 10 interviews in NVivo and came up with the insights. From my interviews, I found that:

## User Interviews (2/2)

### Finished the rest 5 interviews.
This week, I finished my last 5 interviews in the U.S.. Ready for analyzing the interviews!

##### Dec 1st, 2019 - Jan 14th, 2020
## User Interviews (1/2)

### Discussion Guide
Before conducting my interviews, I thought about what I wanted to get out of this interview and how I was going to get there: 

> CENTRAL QUESTIONS: 
> - What kind of relationships of content between tabs help users recall the context of a previous web-based academic search?
> - What kind of visual elements do they use to develop the relationships?
>
> TYPE OF INTERVIEW: Semi-structure
>
> DATA ANALYSIS TYPE: Thematic analysis

Then I began thinking about the questions that can help me get the answers to the central questions. Because this was the first time writing interview questions, I had a really hard time finding out what kind of questions to ask. My first version of the discussion guide totally failed in my pilot test. After several iterations, I finally found out what questions to ask that can actually help me to get the answers to the central questions. The same with the demographic survey.

​How I got to the final version was that I started thinking about in order to get the answers to my central questions, what kind of information do I need to get to that point. Therefore, I divided my interview questions into different sections asking about:
+ Types of Research
+ Tab Using Behavior
+ Types of the Relationships between tabs
+ Visual Hints used to identify the Relationships
+ Previous Experience with Tab Management Tools

Turns out this new version actually went out really well! During the winter break, I finished 5 interviews in China.

## Competitive Analysis  

### Design Precedents
I did a competitive analysis of 6 typical design precedents of my product.

There are two types of design precedents:

1. Manually group the tabs by themes
    *E.g.: Toby, Graphitabs, Tabs Outlier, Workona, Feedly, Pocket, Instapaper, Kurator, etc.*
2. Manually organize the content from tabs
    *E.g.: Evernote, Diigo, Microsoft Word/Google Doc, etc.*

Based on the result of the feature audit, I identified the biggest gap of the current products which is **a lack of interpretation of the relations through graphical overviews**.

From all findings above, I came up with my design questions for this project:
+ How might we better communicate the relationships of content between tabs to help recall the context of the previous search of a topic?
+ How might we make the process of search-based multitasking more effective?

## Secondary Research  

### Motivation
This idea comes from my own story. I have been suffering from having too many tabs open on my browser for a long time. I cannot either finish reading a tab given the limited amount of time or feel comfortable closing any tabs. I always have a fear of losing the information I have read. Therefore, I decided to come up with a solution to it.

### Issues with Tabs
I did some searches about the tab using history. 

Providing the world of information at the fingertip, the internet has become an essential part of our life. In 2018, the average hours that Americans spent on the internet per week was 22.5 hours. Studies showed the use of internet covered a wide range of purposes and have replaced some traditional information-gathering methods, for example, information retrieval for academic research. Over two-thirds of internet users who are students go online at least once daily to get information for academic-related activities. Due to the increasing complexity of the information environment, people were found to be engaged in multitasking on web-based search such as searching on multiple topics simultaneously while switching back and forth. The provision of browser tabs has made multitasking search easier by increasing the volume of parallel browsing, the most common browsing behavior today.

However, tabs can not optimize web-based search because they fail to address the issue of multitasking:

* Multitasking during web search demands constant context switching at the cost of increased cognitive load. Limited working memory limits the retention of the relationships between information retrieved while switching from one topic to the next.

* The affordance offered by tabs does not positively increase association and relationships of content between related tabs.

This project aims to investigate how users develop associations of content between tabs while doing web-based search and to identify factors that hinder this process in context switching. The final goal is to develop a tab management tool that optimizes the process to increase the effectiveness of parallel browsing in web-based search.

### Coming up with a research question
> What design elements improve the communication of relationships between tabs for web-based research?

### Insights from the secondary research
I looked up the previous work of tab using behavior and best practice for improving the effectiveness of information gathering when using tabs on web-based search. The insights from the existing research include:

* Multitasking information behavior ranges over multiple topics 
* A coherent series of tasks for coordination during multitasking information behavior include:  seeking, searching, interactive browsing and retrieving, and constructing information.
* Signaling the rhetorical relations between web pages helps with comprehension, reading times’ efficiency and navigation of web search.
* Graphical overview interface supported flexible navigation across web pages 
* Graphical-overview supports the interpretation of inter-textual relations between web pages

Design implications informed by the insights above are as follows:

Web features should allow users to...
* access, refine, and use results from a previous search within the confines of a session across multiple topics.
* add notes to different or related search topics
* easily track multiple queries concurrently on different or related topics 
* rearrange multiple queries
* easily generate and compare relevance judgments from different or related searches
* create clusters of retrieved information related to different topics.
* tag rhetorical relations between pages
* better interpret the relations through graphical overviews
