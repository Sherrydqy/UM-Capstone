## Secondary Research  

### Motivation
This idea comes from my own story. I have been suffering from having too many tabs open on my browser for a long time. I cannot either finish reading a tab given the limited amount of time or feel comfortable closing any tabs. I always have a fear of losing the information I have read. Therefore, I decided to come up with a solution to it.

### Issues with Tabs
I did some searches about the tab using history. 

Providing the world of information at the fingertip, the internet has become an essential part of our life. In 2018, the average hours that Americans spent on the internet per week was 22.5 hours. Studies showed the use of internet covered a wide range of purposes and have replaced some traditional information-gathering methods, for example, information retrieval for academic research. Over two-thirds of internet users who are students go online at least once daily to get information for academic-related activities. Due to the increasing complexity of the information environment, people were found to be engaged in multitasking on web-based search such as searching on multiple topics simultaneously while switching back and forth. The provision of browser tabs has made multitasking search easier by increasing the volume of parallel browsing, the most common browsing behavior today.

However, tabs can not optimize web-based search because they fail to address the issue of multitasking:

* Multitasking during web search demands constant context switching at the cost of increased cognitive load. Limited working memory limits the retention of the relationships between information retrieved while switching from one topic to the next.

* The affordance offered by tabs does not positively increase association and relationships of content between related tabs.

This project aims to investigate how users develop associations of content between tabs while doing web-based search and to identify factors that hinder this process in context switching. The final goal is to develop a tab management tool that optimizes the process to increase the effectiveness of parallel browsing in web-based search.

### Coming up with a research question
> What design elements improve the communication of relationships between tabs for web-based research?

### Insights from the secondary research
I looked up the previous work of tab using behavior and best practice for improving the effectiveness of information gathering when using tabs on web-based search. The insights from the existing research include:

* Multitasking information behavior ranges over multiple topics 
* A coherent series of tasks for coordination during multitasking information behavior include:  seeking, searching, interactive browsing and retrieving, and constructing information.
* Signaling the rhetorical relations between web pages helps with comprehension, reading times’ efficiency and navigation of web search.
* Graphical overview interface supported flexible navigation across web pages 
* Graphical-overview supports the interpretation of inter-textual relations between web pages

Design implications informed by the insights above are as follows:

Web features should allow users to...
* access, refine, and use results from a previous search within the confines of a session across multiple topics.
* add notes to different or related search topics
* easily track multiple queries concurrently on different or related topics 
* rearrange multiple queries
* easily generate and compare relevance judgments from different or related searches
* create clusters of retrieved information related to different topics.
* tag rhetorical relations between pages
* better interpret the relations through graphical overviews
